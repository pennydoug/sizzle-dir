# Sizzle your directories

If you have a mess of image files for multiple listings in
one directory and need to create directories and then
sort the images into the directories, let this script
do that for you

This will parse the filenames and then create the appropriate
directories and then copy the files inside of them

All hypens and spaces will be converted to underscores.
Use of demarcations besides hypens, underscores, or spaces 
in filenames is currently not supported. 

## Usage
1) Navigate to your desired directory from the command-line
1) Run sizzle.py from the directory, e.g. `~/code/sizzle.py`
